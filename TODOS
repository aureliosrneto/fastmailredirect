Planned features for the next major release
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


* Installation: Check, if the extension MailRedirect by Pawel Krzesniak is 
  installed. If not, then give a warning.

* A true "one click redirect". 
  Click on the e-mail address and send the message without 
  any additional steps by the user.
	
* automatic disposition of message. After clicking on the message, 
  move the message to another mailbox.
	
* one click by icon. These iconic representation of address 
  instead of explicit address.
	
* One click by 'Name'. Use the name displayed (if any) in the card/list in the Address Book instead of explicit address?
	
* standard configuration set up. If this feature is deployed 
  across an organization, it would be nice to give the administrators 
  the ability to install a standard set of addresses automatically as 
  part of the installation process. This could either be by rebuilding 
  the xpi file with standard data or a separate configuration file.
